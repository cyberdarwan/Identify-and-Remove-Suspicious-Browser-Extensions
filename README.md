## Task 7: Identify and Remove Suspicious Browser Extensions

### Extensions Installed:
- AdBlocker ✅ (safe)
- DownThemAll ✅ (safe)
- FoxyProxy ✅ (safe)
- KeePassXC ✅ (safe)
- ScrapBee ⚠️ (under review)
- Search by Image ✅ (safe)
- Wappalyzer ✅ (safe)

### Actions Taken:
- **Reviewed** all extensions’ permissions, ratings, and usage.

- Be cautious of lesser-known tools like ScrapBee unless absolutely required and trustworthy.
